## Technical Architecture

### Components

#### AIAssistant
Main chat interface component with:
- Message display and management
- Voice input/output controls
- Settings integration
- Real-time processing indicators

#### AIService
Backend service handling:
- Natural language processing
- Skill routing and execution
- Memory management
- Context awareness

#### AISettings
Comprehensive settings modal with:
- Voice configuration
- Memory management
- Skill toggles
- Personality customization

### Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Text or voice input is captured
2. **Processing**: AI service analyzes and routes to appropriate skill
3. **Memory Storage**: Input and context are stored in memory
4. **Response Generation**: Skill generates appropriate response
5. **Context Enhancement**: Response is enhanced with memory context
6. **Output**: Response is displayed and optionally spoken

### Memory System

#### Memory Types
- **Conversation**: User messages and assistant responses
- **Preference**: User settings and preferences
- **Fact**: Important information learned from conversations
- **Reminder**: Scheduled reminders and tasks
- **Task**: Active tasks and to-dos

#### Memory Management
- **Importance Scoring**: 1-10 scale based on content analysis
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes low-priority items when limit reached
- **Context Linking**: Connects related memory items
- **Emotion Tracking**: Stores emotional context of interactions

### Skill System

#### Skill Structure
Each skill has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Human-readable name
- **Description**: What the skill does
- **Keywords**: Trigger words for skill activation
- **Handler**: Function that processes the skill
- **Enabled**: Whether the skill is active

#### Adding New Skills
1. Define skill interface in `AIService`
2. Implement skill handler function
3. Add skill to skills array
4. Update UI components if needed

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 79+

### Required APIs
- Web Speech API (for voice features)

- Modern JavaScript features (ES2020+)

### Fallbacks
- Voice features gracefully degrade if not supported
- Memory system works without voice features
- All core functionality available via text input

## Performance

### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand
- **Memory Management**: Intelligent cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Debounced Input**: Prevents excessive API calls
